# General Information
> The dataset used for this project contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue
> Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
> There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.
>The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

# CONCLUSION

- 1. Columns like homepage,tagline,keywords and production_companies had a lot of Nan values and had to be dropped even though they could yielded a lot of  useful insights

- 2. The budget_adj and revenue_adj columns seemed very interesting but I did not have the expertise to understand what they represented.
