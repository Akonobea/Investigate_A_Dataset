# General Information
> The dataset used for this project contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue
> Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
> There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.
>The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

# QUESTIONS FOR THIS ANALYSIS
- 1.How is budget data distributed?
- 2.Do movies with high popularity have more revenues?
- 3.What are the top 20 most popular movies?
- 4.What are the top 20 movies with the highest revenue?
- 5.What are the top 20 most popular genres?
- 6.Which words occur the most in the title of movies?
- 7.Which words occur the most in movie overviews?

# Setup
- 1.Open google colab through this link <a>https://colab.research.google.com/</a>
![Sample cell in google collab](https://github.com/Akonobea/Investigate_A_Dataset/blob/main/sample_cell.png)
- 2.Click on upload and then proceed to upload the files in this repository
![Sample cell in google collab](https://github.com/Akonobea/Investigate_A_Dataset/blob/main/colab.png)
- 3.Alternatively, you can click on on github(after step 1),then enter the Url to this repository
- 4.Open the file with extension .ipynb
- **NB** : A notebook is made of a group of cells that may or may not run independtly.

- 4.To run a cell use shift+Enter. **NB** To run the ipynb file ,it is important to make sure the .csv file is in the same folder as the .ipynb file else there will be errors

# CONCLUSION

- 1. Columns like homepage,tagline,keywords and production_companies had a lot of Nan values and had to be dropped even though they could yielded a lot of  useful insights

- 2. The budget_adj and revenue_adj columns seemed very interesting but I did not have the expertise to understand what they represented.

>Question 1: How is budget data distributed?

- Answer : The histogram shows that budget data is skewed to the left

>Question 2: Do movies with high popularity have more revenues?

- Answer : Not necessarily.The analysis showed that movies with low popularity have less revenue but movies with high popularity can sometimes have high revenues or low revenues.

>Question 4:What are the top 20 movies with the highest revenue?

- Answer :  The highest earning movies are Avatar ,Starwars:The force Awakens just to mention a few.

>Question 5 :What are the top 20 most popular genres?

>Question 7: Which words occur the most in movie overviews?

- Answer: The most popular words in movie overviews are **years**,**Twenty**,**two**,**events**
# Project Status
> This project is still in progress
# Room For Improvement
- 1.Exploring the relationship between the budget and revenue even further
- 2.Exploring columns like budget_adj and revenue_adj
